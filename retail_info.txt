"Project Title: Eco-Retail — Intelligent Inventory Optimization & Dynamic Pricing Engine
1. The Real-Life Problem

Supermarkets and grocery stores lose billions of dollars annually due to perishable goods (fruits, dairy, vegetables) reaching their expiry dates before they can be sold. This results in:

Financial Loss: Unsold inventory.

Environmental Impact: Methane emissions from rotting food in landfills.

Inefficiency: Static pricing models do not react fast enough to demand changes or approaching expiry dates.

2. The Solution Overview

Create a unified system that tracks inventory age, predicts daily demand using Machine Learning, and uses an AI agent to automatically adjust prices (Dynamic Pricing) to ensure items are sold before they spoil.

3. Technical Integration (Subject Breakdown)

Here is how each of your required subjects fits into the architecture:

A. Database Management Systems (DBMS)

The backbone of the application. You cannot perform ML without structured historical data.

Role: Store product details, batch numbers, expiry dates, real-time transaction logs, and customer purchase history.

Technical Implementation:

SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL): For structured transactional data (e.g., Table: Transactions, Table: Inventory_Batches).

Concepts: Normalization (3NF) to reduce redundancy, Indexing for fast queries, and Stored Procedures to automatically flag items nearing expiry (e.g., WHERE expiry_date < CURRENT_DATE + 3).

B. Data Science (DS)

The analytical layer that processes raw data into insights.

Role: Cleaning the sales data, handling missing values, and visualizing waste trends.

Technical Implementation:

ETL Pipeline: Python scripts using Pandas to extract data from the SQL DB, transform it (handling nulls, formatting dates), and load it for analysis.

Visualization: A dashboard (using PowerBI, Tableau, or Streamlit) showing "Top Wasted Items," "Revenue Recovered by Dynamic Pricing," and "Peak Shopping Hours."

C. Machine Learning (ML)

The predictive engine.

Role: Forecasting demand. You need to know: How many units of Milk Brand X will we sell tomorrow?

Technical Implementation:

Algorithm: Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet) or Regression models (XGBoost/Random Forest).

Features: Day of week, holidays, weather data (external API), and historical sales.

Output: Predicted demand vs. Current stock.

D. Artificial Intelligence (AI)

The decision-making agent.

Role: Dynamic Pricing. If the ML model predicts low demand but high stock nearing expiry, the AI must lower the price to incentivize purchase.

Technical Implementation:

Logic: A Rule-Based System or a simple Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent (Q-Learning).

Action: If Days_To_Expiry < 3 AND Predicted_Sales < Current_Stock, calculate the optimal discount (e.g., 15% off) that maximizes revenue without resulting in a total loss.

4. System Architecture & Workflow

Input: The store manager scans a batch of milk cartons into the DBMS.

Processing:

Every morning, the ML Model predicts sales for the milk.

The DBMS flags that this batch expires in 2 days.

Decision:

The AI Agent sees: Stock = 50, Predicted Sales = 20, Expiry = 2 days.

Calculation: We will have 30 unsold units.

Action: Trigger a digital price tag update: 'Flash Sale: 30% Off.'

Feedback: The system records if the price drop led to increased sales, feeding this data back into the DB for future training.

5. Suggested Tech Stack

Component	Technology
Language	Python 3.9+
Database	PostgreSQL (Production) or SQLite (Prototype)
ML/AI Libraries	Scikit-Learn, Statsmodels, TensorFlow (optional for RL)
Data Processing	Pandas, NumPy
Backend API	Flask or FastAPI (to serve predictions to the app)
Frontend	Streamlit (for a quick, professional data app) or React
6. Why This Project Stands Out?

Complexity: It moves beyond simple 'prediction' (ML) to 'action' (AI/Pricing).

Business Value: It directly addresses ROI (Return on Investment).

Full Stack Data Science: It demonstrates you can build the pipeline (Data Engineering), build the model (ML), and deploy the insights (App dev).
